<F P=106> [Interview with Pavel Borodin, administrator of affairs of </F>
the president of the Russian Federation, by Andrey Uglanov:
"Ministers Come and Go, but the Administrative Machinery
Remains"]
  [Text] State machinery is eternal. Without it--there
is anarchy and chaos. The ministers, deputies, and the thousands
of people who stand behind them need housing, communications,
and the organization of rest. Our interlocutor is Pavel Borodin,
administrator of affairs of the president of the Russian
Federation.
  [Uglanov] Pavel Pavlovich, what is the secret of your very
rapid career--from Yakutia to Moscow, and immediately to the
Kremlin?
  [Borodin] I am an economist by education. I did not engage
in
party work. I spent the last five years as mayor of Yakutsk. I
did not write slogans, I worked. In 1990 Boris Yeltsin flew to
Yakutsk during the harshest season: December, the temperature
was minus 57 degrees centigrade, and the aircraft barely landed.
He looked at how the economy of the city was being run under
these very difficult conditions. Apparently, he remembered what
he saw. Last year I received an invitation to Moscow. I did not
refuse.
  [Uglanov] You were a people's deputy of the Russian
Federation. Do you have any nostalgic feelings for those times?
  [Borodin] It is impossible simply to up and severely
criticize everything that was done by us. We legislatively
turned the economy toward the market, and we introduced the
institution of the president in Russia. At the same time, I
cannot say that our successors got rid of all the defects of the
preceding convocation. As for nostalgia, three years as a deputy
contained so many events that they will never leave my memory.
  [Uglanov] Just what are the presidential services? How and
with what is the numerous retinue provided?
  [Borodin] Even though we are called the administration of
affairs of the president of the Russian Federation, we are more
like a federal service that supports the vital activity of all
the higher federal organs of authority. I have in mind the staff
of the president, the government apparatus, the staff of the
Federation Council and the State Duma, and the apparatus of all
the courts: the Constitutional Court, Supreme Court, and Court
of Arbitration. It is maintenance of buildings, reconstruction,
technical reequipping, motor vehicle service, rest, and hotel
management. There are more than 30,000 workers and 75
enterprises in the administration of affairs. These are
government buildings, the Kremlin, hotels, truck farms, rest
homes, tailoring establishments, and shoe repair shops. That is,
a state within a state.
  [Uglanov] The circle is closed? Previously there was an
administration of affairs of the CPSU Central Committee. It was
also responsible for everything.
  [Borodin] We combined the administration of affairs of the
CPSU Central Committee, the USSR Supreme Soviet, the USSR
Council of Ministers, the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR, and the
RSFSR Council of Ministers. The number of chiefs was reduced by
a factor of exactly five. Practically all the workers remained.
It was very difficult to retain top professionals at a wage of
10-15,000 rubles [R]. But now we have been authorized to support
our own budget owing to commercial activity. All summer home
operations have been removed from the state budget and are on
self-financing. The same goes for hotels.
  [Uglanov] You are a high-ranking civil servant. Many think
that indispensable attributes of a civil servant are a big
chair, a beautiful secretary, and long negotiations behind a
lavish table with drinks.
  [Borodin] I essentially have a nonstandard workday. In a
year's work here I had only a couple of free Sundays. I have a
car telephone, a summer home telephone, and a home telephone. I
can be called and contacted everywhere. There is work, work... I
have been in this position a year, and I would like to say
several good words to the workers of the administration of
affairs and support those civil servants with whom we work.
  [Uglanov] There is a visible side of the life of a civil
servant. But there is also an invisible side, which in our
consciousness is associated with some kind of pleasures that are
not accessible to everyone.
  [Borodin] He does not receive pleasures very often, and not
very much. The average wage is R150-200,000. The very highest,
of course, even get R700,000. Civil servants of higher rank get
personal summer homes. I have in mind ministers and chiefs of
main administrations.
  [Uglanov] Summer homes with cooks?
  [Borodin] There is a law which was adopted by the former
Supreme Soviet. Only guarded persons are provided cooks. There
are about 20 such persons today. They have both cooks and guards.
  [Uglanov] Are these summer homes being privatized.
  [Borodin] No. According to an edict of the president, the
privatization of state summer homes is categorically prohibited.
  There is a second category of senior civil servants, of
which
there are about 150. They have summer homes year round. There
are also those who get summer homes only for the summer season.
There are approximately 200 of these persons. We rent some of
the summer homes to commercial structures: Resources are needed
to maintain this operation. Moreover, the civil servants and
businessmen live separately. There is a system of rest homes for
Saturdays and Sundays.
  [Uglanov] When the Politburo was located here, people were
invited to work in Moscow, frequently through political
influence. They were given elegant apartments. How is your
practice different?
  [Borodin] We are now doing our own construction, on the
order
of 200-300 apartments a year. We also have an agreement with the
Government of Moscow about acquiring another 500 apartments in a
year. A tough procedure for their allocation has been
established. If we invite ministers or first deputy ministers to
Moscow, they receive a right of permanent residence without a
license. If a rank lower, the inviting structure pays for the
license, Very few prestigious apartments are being built.
Ordinary prefabricated houses.
  [Uglanov] As far as I can recall, every ruler who comes to
power in Russia tries to build himself a residence. And Boris
Nikolayevich?
  [Borodin] He has a number of suburban residences. All of
this
corresponds to diplomatic protocol. Everything remains that
there was before. No new residences are being built or financed.
There are many rumors. But I work on this matter directly. He
leads the life of an ordinary person.
  [Uglanov] The Soviet Union had significant property abroad.
There were rumors that there are islands in the Aegean Sea that
were given to Russian tsars at one time.
  [Borodin] This is a very difficult question. There are no
intergovernmental agreements. What was in Ukraine became
Ukrainian, and what was in the Baltics became Baltic.
  [Uglanov] That is all the Crimean residences of the Russian
emperors...
  [Borodin] Yes. They are going to ruin, because they require
proper capital investments. They have to be reconstructed, and
it is necessary to manage them. It is generally a paradox: It is
better to let them go to ruin, to collapse, but not to give them
to anyone.
  [Uglanov] Do you have any contacts with your colleagues in
Ukraine?
  [Borodin] We are attempting to prepare a number of
intergovernmental agreements. With both Ukraine and the Baltics.
But everything is getting bogged down.
  [Uglanov] You are an experienced executive. Do you sense
that
it is already possible to work in Russia, or do you use the
"sovereign's knout?"
  [Borodin] As for the sovereign's knout, this is absolutely
not the case. We want to work in a rule-of-law, economic space
of Russia, and only according to its laws.
  Some regulating laws, edicts, and statutes are necessary.
There are many complicated problems. But today we have the kind
of society in which people who are able to work feel like a fish
in water. There are difficulties outside the borders of the
Russian Federation. But inside, any problem can be resolved, if
you are able to work. Specialists have already grown up in the
banking business, in construction, in trade; moreover, they are
young men. Today, heads decide everything. And there is an
infinite number of proposals.
